[*] When I open the day planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

[*] When I scroll down I want to see timeblocks for standard business hours 9am-5pm

[] When I look at the timeblocks for the day each timeblock is color coded to indictae whther it is past, present or future.
{grey = events have already happened}
{red = current hour}
{green = future events (new)}

[] When I click into a timeblock I can enter an event

[] When I click the save button for that timeblock the text for that event is saved in local storage

[] When the page is refreshed the saved events should still show

![A user clicks on slots on the color-coded calendar and edits the events.](./Assets/05-third-party-apis-homework-demo.gif)
